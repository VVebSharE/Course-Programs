/*13. Create some objects of the string class, and put them in a Deque – some at the head of the Deque
and some at the tail. Display the contents of the Deque using the for Each( ) function and a user
written display function . Then search the Deque for a particular strings, using the first That ( )
Function and display any string that match, finally remove all the item from the date using the get
left( ) Function and display each item. Not ice is the order in which the item are displayed: Using
Get Left ( ), Those inserted on the left ( head),of the Deque are removed in “last and first out”
order while those put on the right side are removed in “first in first out” order. The opposite
would be true if Get right ( ) were used*/

//std::find_first_of is used to compare elements between two containers. It compares all the elements in a range [first1,last1) with the elements in the range [first2,last2), and if any of the elements present in the second range is found in the first one , then it returns an iterator to that element.
